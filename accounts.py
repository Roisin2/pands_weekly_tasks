# Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number 
# and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing ...
# (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
# Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
# (XXXXXX7890)
# Extra:
# Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length ...
# (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)
