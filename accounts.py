# Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number 
# and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing ...
# (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs). 

#created a new variable called hidden_num ,
#first 6 charachters of hidden_num are set to x and remaining numbers are the original
#hidden_num = "X" * 6 + account_num [6:]
#print/return (hidden_num)
# reference()



# Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
# (XXXXXX7890)
# check there is 10 numbers
 #if len(account_number) :! = 10 # return "incorrect number, please enter 10 digit account number"
#(reference)
