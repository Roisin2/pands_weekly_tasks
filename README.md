# pands_weekly_tasks
Weekly task hand up.

## About this work.
    Below is a list of the weekly tasks assigned for hands on learning.
    I am a new learner in this enviornment and I did extensive reading and learning through various websites. Such as (https://realpython.com/search)
    (https://stackoverflow.com/) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org).

    ### List of Tasks.
    bank.py
    accounts.py
    weekday.py
    collatz.py
    squareroot.py
    plottask.py
    es.py
    
## Use of this project.
    In doing these tasks, I was required to cover the course material but also source my own help through the linked websites. The class also has a group chat that helped 
    me when I got a bit lost with the technology along the way. There are links to references and sources beside the code within the py's.
    
    For Bank.py I needed to change float to an integer and do addition, and printing the answer.
    
    For accounts.py, a user is prompted to enter a 10 digit code and the program will check if exactly 10 digits, if the entry was valid, it will mask 6 numbers 
    with X and append the last 4 and print it out.

    Weekday.py - I imported datetime module. Returning the day of the week as an integer, eg. Monday is 0. Loop is used to check what day it is and prints a message         
    according to the day.

    Collatz.py -This was a little tricky, Maths was needed.
    While the number was not 1, %  was used for checking if a number could be divived by 2. (even number). If a number wasnt even, multiplication and addition was required.     The user is asked to enter a positive number, (printing if positive) If user entered a negitive number they were given a promt to please enter a positive integer. If it     was an odd number the program would print eg This is The Collatz Sequence
                                                Enter a positive integer: 5
                                                sucessive values of sequence: [5, 16]

    Squareroot.py - 
    The abs module was imported to change a negitive to a positive
    

## Getting started.
     There were requirements for Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) in order to work with the repository in Github.
     The code used is python, so Annaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download) was also down loaded and used. It has so many built in functions such as Pandas, Matplotlib        and Numpy.
     

## Author
    I study at [ATU] (https://www.atu.ie/). I am a mature student returning to education. I have a Bachelors of Business Studies from the former Institute of Technology Sligo - now part of ATU. I find this an interesting subject and hope to continue learning online from the beautiful north west of Ireland. I will be looking for work in the near future and at this moment I will leave my contact as my University Email.
