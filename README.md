## Use of this project.

## Getting started.
     There were requirements for Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) in order to work with the repository in Github.
     The code used is python, so Annaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download) was also down loaded and used. It has so many built in functions such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy.

    I study at [ATU] (https://www.atu.ie/). I am a mature student returning to education. I have a Bachelors of Business Studies from the former Institute of Technology Sligo - now part of ATU. I find this an interesting subject and hope to continue learning online from the beautiful north west of Ireland. I will be looking for work in the near future and at this moment I will leave my contact as my University Email.
