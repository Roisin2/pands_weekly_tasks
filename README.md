# pands_weekly_tasks
Weekly task hand up.

## About this work.
    Below is a list of the weekly tasks assigned for hands on learning.
    I am a new learner in this enviornment and I did extensive reading and learning through various websites. Such as (https://realpython.com/search)
    (https://stackoverflow.com/) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org).

    ### List of Tasks.
    bank.py
    accounts.py
    weekday.py
    collatz.py
    squareroot.py
    plottask.py
    es.py

        ### About the tasks.
        1. The program will prompt the user to enter in 2 amounts and add them. print out with â‚¬ and (.).bank.py is name of program.

        
        2. Python program that reads in a 10 character a/c number and outputs the a/c number with the last 4 digits showing (the 1st 6 digits replaced Xs).
            (Extra:Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length)
            
        4. A program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the next value bt taking current number if even, divide  divide by 2,
            if odd multiply by 3 and add 1. end program at 1.
            This was a difficult task for me and I spent much time reading through websites about python .
        
        3. A program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. (The program is called weekday.py) I needed to research about finding out how the date is found. 
            
        
        5. A program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. Task was to create a function called             
            <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this, not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
            this also was a tough task for me.

        6. A program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's within. The program takes the filename from an argument on the command line.
            I was a bit uncertain as to how to approach this task. Much time was spent deliberating and reading.


        7. A program called plottask.py that displays a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
            and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10.
            This was mostly an easier task as it had been delt with in another module however a simple over sight had me perplexed as I could not get a visual of the plot.
            I had simply forgotten to type "()". This task i probably enjoyed most.

 
## Use of this project.

## Getting started.
     There were requirements for Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) in order to work with the repository in Github.
     The code used is python, so Annaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download) was also down loaded and used. It has so many built in functions such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy.


## Author
    I study at [ATU] (https://www.atu.ie/). I am a mature student returning to education. I have a Bachelors of Business Studies from the former Institute of Technology Sligo - now part of ATU. I find this an interesting subject and hope to continue learning online from the beautiful north west of Ireland. I will be looking for work in the near future and at this moment I will leave my contact as my University Email.
