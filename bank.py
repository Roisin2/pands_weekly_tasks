# read in the amounts in cents
amount1 = 65
amount2 = 180

# change to Euro (100c in a euro) and change float to integer
e1 = int(amount1) / 100
e2 = int(amount2) / 100

# add the two amounts
total_money = e1 + e2

# print the amounts with decimal point and only two numbers after the point. 
print (f"the sum of the amounts is â‚¬{total_money:.2f}")
